## Introduction

The notebooks in this repository were developed for a Ph.D. course (taught in spring 2023 at the LSE) to explore the CRSP dataset, as provided by WRDS.

The course works with the updated file format (2.0, CIZ) introduced in July 2022 by CRSP.

The course starts with reviewing distributions and delistings before implementing some descriptive statistics on the US equity market and backtesting some simple trading strategies. The course also discusses some pitfalls of such empirical analyses (e.g., survivorship bias; data leakage; handling of stocks that default).

Comments and corrections are welcome.
